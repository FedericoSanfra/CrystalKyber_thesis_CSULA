# ThesisTurboCodes Rust Implementation
Thesis project at CSULA on Crystals Kyber algorithm and the software implementation in Rust coding language of Turbo codes error correction and detection with BCJR variant for space applications. The code is implementing a BSC channel with a p error probability, in order to model radiation errors single and multiple bit event upset.
